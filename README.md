What is this?

![Snagit Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/g6aTS.png)

A plugin ("accessory") for [TechSmith® Snagit®](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) that allows sending captured images to online image sharing sites, such as [http://imgur.com](http://imgur.com).

This plugin adds a button on the **Share** (**Send** in Snagit® v10) tab of the Image Editor, allowing you to upload the currently selected image to **Imgur**:

![Snagit Toolbar](http://i.imgur.com/JjRl7.png)

It is also added to the main menu:

You can change the position of the **Imgur** button in the Editor Options.

Download and installation instructions
======================================

1. Download the zip file `SnagitImgur0.1.1.zip` from the [Downloads](https://github.com/hmemcpy/SnagitImgur/downloads) page.

2. Extract the contents of the zip file into:

    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\TechSmith\Snagit\Accessories`

3. Go to the extracted directory:  

    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\TechSmith\Snagit\Accessories\{EDA9F1DD-85B9-44F6-9D3C-125B2DD1109D}`
    
    and run the file **register.bat**

4. Restart Snagit (you should choose _Exit Snagit_ from the icon in the notification area)

A proper installer will be available in the future!
----------------------------------------------------

What can it do now?
-------------------

The plugin uploads the currently selected image in the Snagit Editor to imgur.com, and opens a browser with a link to the uploaded image.

It currently only uploads as PNG, and uses an anonymous upload.

What will it do in the future?
------------------------------

Oh, many things:

* Using own imgur account
* Choosing uploading format
* Multiple image hosts support
* **Installer!**
* Many other cool stuff

Special thanks **Stephen Kunkel** for creating the coolest Imgur/Snagit icon!
